I am [Professor of Natural Language Processing](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/chenghua-lin) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I also serve as the Secretary and a Board Member of [ACL SIGGEN](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/SIGGEN), and a Member of the [IEEE Speech and Language Processing Technical Committee](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/community-involvement/speech-and-language-processing).   
My research primarily focuses on natural language processing and generation, machine learning, and their intersection. Current key interests include robustness in LLMs, AI for science, evaluation methods and benchmarks, creative text generation, [lay summarisation](https://biolaysumm.org/), metaphor processing, as well as representation learning for [music](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v1-330M) and speech.
My work has been supported by various funding bodies, including [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/), [ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/), [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/), [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/), [BBC Connected Studio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/connected-studio/), [BBC News Lab](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rdnewslabs/), and [Samsung Reasarch UK](https://research.samsung.com/sruk).

## Personal  

I am a die-hard fan of the [90s Chicago Bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls). I used to play basketball a lot and was part of the starting lineup for my school's basketball team at my university in Beijing. Our team won two championships in the college league, which I am quite proud of, even though the matches were amateur. I stopped playing intensively after completely rupturing one of my [Achilles tendons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon_rupture) during a match. Nevertheless, I still play for fun and occasionally, join the practice games of a team from the [Sheffield basketball league](https://www.sheffieldbasketball.co.uk/).
