I am Professor of Natural Language Processing in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My research is centred around natural language processing and generation, machine learning, and the intersection between them. Specific interests include developing probabilistic generative and deep learning models for data-to-text generation, dialogue systems, text summarisation, metaphor processing, as well as representation learning for music and speech.
My research has been funded by various funding bodies including: EPSRC, ESRC, Innovate UK, Royal Society, BBC Connected Studios, BBC News Lab.

## Research
For more details, please see [Research](./research.md) page.

#### Paraphrase generation & recognition
Paraphrasing takes various forms of monolingual text transformations, such as text simplification, rewriting, and style transfer. 
We work on both recognition and generation. The core technologies are intelligent phrase alignment and controllable paraphrase generation.

#### Representation learning
Vector representation of words, phrases, and sentences are the very basis for NLP research. We study
1. sophisticated representations for word meaning in context and multilingual sentences,
2. efficient pre-trained models for words and phrases, and
3. representations for few-shot learning.

#### NLP for language education & learning
As a central application of our research outcomes, we develop technologies for language learning and education supports. 
Our technology covers from fine-grained lexical-level transformations to coarse-grained text-level processing.
