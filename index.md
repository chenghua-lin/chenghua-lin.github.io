I am [Professor of Natural Language Processing](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/chenghua-lin) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My research is centred around natural language processing and generation, machine learning, and the intersection between them. Specific interests include developing probabilistic generative and deep learning models for data-to-text generation, dialogue systems, text summarisation, metaphor processing, as well as representation learning for music and speech.
My research has been funded by various funding bodies including: [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/), [ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/), [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/), [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/), [BBC Connected Studio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/connected-studio/), [BBC News Lab](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rdnewslabs/), and [Samsung Reasarch UK](https://research.samsung.com/sruk).

#### Paraphrase generation & recognition
Paraphrasing takes various forms of monolingual text transformations, such as text simplification, rewriting, and style transfer. 
We work on both recognition and generation. The core technologies are intelligent phrase alignment and controllable paraphrase generation.
